Pantry!
=================

**Pantry** is a test I was requested to do as part of a recruiting program.

And this git project is the result.


**Installation**
================
There are two methods to run this app:

 - A static version can be found inside the folder **build**.
 
 - Start a local static web server instance to serve the app by running 
```$ yarn```
```$ gulp sass``` 
```$ yarn start```
It's assumed you have **npm executable** installed globally.

After this, your default web browser will be opened to show the app automatically.
